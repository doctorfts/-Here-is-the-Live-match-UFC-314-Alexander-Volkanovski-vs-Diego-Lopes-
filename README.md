# -Here-is-the-Live-match-UFC-314-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-

Alexander Volkanovski: The former featherweight champ (26-4 record) is seeking his belt after he lost it to Ilia Topuria at UFC 298 in Feb. 2024. Volkanovski has not fought in more than a year since suffering knockout defeats in back-to-back outings against Topuria and Islam Makhachev. Still, he’s one of the most accomplished fighters in the division, winning the belt and defending it five times during his reign.
Diego Lopes: The Brazilian (26-6) comes into this matchup on a five-fight run, with wins over Brian Ortega and Dan Ige standing out. Lopes has some of the best striking power and also shows great resilience which makes a real threat to Volkanovski. It will be his first title fight in the UFC.
Key Factors
Volkanovski’s Experience: The reigning champion before Islam, Volkanovski utilized fight IQ and cardio to win championship rounds. His toughness, however, could become a question with the potential of being knocked out again.
Lopes’ Momentum: Lopes has been on a great run and comes into this fight with a lot of confidence. His punching power and aggression could give Volkanovski some trouble early on.
Cardio and Game Plan: If Lopes doesn’t find an early finish, Volkanovski’s conditioning and ability to adjust to an opponent mid-fight might give him an edge.
